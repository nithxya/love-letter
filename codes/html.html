My sweet boy, you mean everything to me. When I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING. I notice how my mood shifts from happy to sad to angry, and so on. The way I feel always depends on how you think. At that moment, I realized I truly fell in love with you. Never thought I’d ever fall in love with someone I met through the internet. I never was the type of person to ever believe on online dating and shit but everything seems so real with you. I can imagine myself being with you for a lifetime. Losing you would break me to pieces, knowing that you’re the first boy I’ve ever loved. I took a risk on wanting to be together with you, knowing how different/difficult it is for me to even date someone in the first place. I truly love you, dear. I may not be the first girl you loved, but I surely want to be the last one to you.

We've had our arguments, and yes, there have been tears, frustration, and moments of silence. But through it all, there’s been overwhelming joy, countless memories filled with laughter, and a love that always found its way back.  Throughout every moment, I know you and I will always stick to our word and love each other forever. There’s never a day that I’ve been scared that you would cheat on me or ever break my trust, because I believe that you love me as much as I love you. I will trust you wholeheartedly, always and forever.

You may be wondering why I’m doing all of this. It’s super cringey!! BUT WHO CARES CUZ IM FUCKING IN LOVE WITH YOU AND I WILL NEVER STOP LOVING YOU NO MATTER WHAT. I’ve inserted a few images above where I’ve felt very happy!! So many other moments to share, but these are a few of my favorites. I love laughing with you!! I realized I’m the type of girl to smile at anyone, speak to anyone with kindness, and hide all my pain behind me.  But when I’m with you, my joy, sadness, and anger are always real. I used to hide the way I feel because I didn’t want people calling me an attention seeker (pick me), but you understood that isn’t really how I am. I feel like I can be myself whenever I’m around you, and I don’t think you would judge me. I feel very comfortable being around you, like you’re home. I love youu my baby!

There have been times when hurtful things have been said (to each other), but I leave it behind me because I love you, and maybe you said it because you care about me. Each day, I try to be a better person for you. I tend not to know when I make mistakes sometimes, and I trust you to be there for me to tell me and correct me. I believe that doing that is a very mature way to solve problems and unsaid thoughts. I never want to go to bed with a heavy heart. I will prioritize YOU, your feelings, your thoughts and etc. You matter most to me, my sweet boy, and nothing/no one can change that.

I’m very much locked in with this relationship; I didn’t do anything like this for any other boy before, which truly shows how much you mean to me. You’re different from the rest, and that is what I love most about you. I hope you will never stop loving me till the day you die, because I know I won’t.

I love you, Jayson. ʚ♡ɞ
